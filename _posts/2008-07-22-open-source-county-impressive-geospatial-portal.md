I keep having to fish around for this URL so I’m just going to blog into this online note space that I maintain. One stop shopping.

<http://maps.co.mecklenburg.nc.us/gp/>

This is the Mecklenburg County GIS data portal to both environmental and [cadastral-type](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadastre) information. I ran across it some time ago as an avid reader of Tobin Bradley’s excellent [blog ](http://maps.co.mecklenburg.nc.us/ft/). I can’t say enough about Tobin’s blog and the work that he writes about. I think he employs some well thought out, no nonsense, light-weight-yet-effective approaches to solving common problems and the the projects he writes about demonstrate clean implementations. The mapping site above and the framework behind it embodies this ethic in my mind.
