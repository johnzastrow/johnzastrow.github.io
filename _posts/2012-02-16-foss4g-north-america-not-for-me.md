After missing the International FOSS4G in Denver (one of my former homes and a great excuse to visit land and friend alike) I’m now likely going to miss [FOSS4G North America](http://foss4g-na.org/) in the territory of my home office in the greater DC area. Argg, this totally bums me out. Somebody take good notes… and get me a T-shirt!
