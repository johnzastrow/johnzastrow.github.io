I'm a big fan of this talk.

Published on Oct 5, 2012  
Paul Ramsey delivers a introductory talk on open source for GIS and IT managers: history, motivation, why to consider it, how to get started with it. This keynote presentation delivered was at the Texas GIS Forum in October 2012.

Paul highlights the weaknesses of traditional GIS, explaining that that the future is Spatial IT professionals working on the Spatial Web.

The current process is time consuming and takes a good deal of expertise. OpenGeo prototyped a web-based alternative that would allow a broader range of stewards to engage in editing NHD data in a way that respects the topology rules inherent to the NHD.
