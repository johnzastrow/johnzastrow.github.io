**This is a living post. Check back for updates as I learned more.**

I've been doing GIS since 1994 and began with a platform then called [TNTmips](https://www.microimages.com/documentation/FeatureSummaries/index.htm). They have these great documents for [learning the platform](https://www.microimages.com/documentation/html/Categories/Terrain%20Analysis%20and%20Operations.htm) and they had a free viewer called [TNTatlas](https://www.microimages.com/documentation/Tutorials/tntatlx.pdf) that you could customize and distribute to clients, along with data. It was a great way to share data and maps with clients who didn't need all the tools of the full TNTmips platform. I haven't seen anything like that in other GIS platforms, so I wondered if I could do something similar with QGIS.

I've been using [QGIS](https://qgis.org) for years and have customized it to my liking. I recently wanted to make a simplified version of QGIS that I could use as a data viewer for clients who don't need all the tools and options that QGIS provides. I also wanted to make it easy to move between computers and operating systems (Windows and Linux).
