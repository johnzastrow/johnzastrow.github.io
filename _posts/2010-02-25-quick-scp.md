Logged into source host

scp -r -p \* root@remotehost:/home/user/public\_html

This will copy \*all\* files to the directory /home/user/public\_html in the remote server remotehost. The -p preserves the modification and access times, as well as the permissions of the source-file in the destination-file. The -r copies the contents of the source-file (directory in this case) recursively.
