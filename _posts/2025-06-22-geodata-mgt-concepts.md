# Are there best practices for backing up and restoring shared geospatial repositories in QGIS

Absolutely! Backing up and restoring shared geospatial repositories—whether file-based or database-backed—is essential for data integrity, disaster recovery, and historical archiving in QGIS environments. Here are **best practices** tailored for small, well-organized organizations, referencing your [Data Management Plan](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/59416266/04aaa6a9-e511-42bf-a2a9-46db6f887b5b/Data-Management-Plan.md) and current industry standards:

---

## **1. General Best Practices**

### **A. Backup Regularly and Systematically**

- **Frequency:** Schedule backups daily for active data, and at least weekly for less frequently updated repositories.
- **Automate:** Use scripts or backup software to automate the process and reduce human error.
- **Test Restores:** Periodically test restoring from backups to ensure data integrity.


### **B. Store Backups Securely**

- **Offsite/Cloud Storage:** Keep at least one backup copy offsite or in the cloud to protect against local disasters.
- **Versioned Backups:** Retain multiple backup versions (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly) to recover from accidental deletions or data corruption.


### **C. Document Backup and Restore Procedures**

- Maintain clear, up-to-date documentation on backup locations, schedules, and restoration steps.
- Train staff on how to access and restore backups.

---

## **2. File-Based Repositories (e.g., GeoPackage, Shapefiles, Directory Trees)**

### **A. Organize Data for Backup**

- Follow your established directory structure (e.g., `DATA/MAIN/subject/year`, `DATA/PROJECTS/year/project`).
- Store authoritative data in read-only directories to minimize accidental changes.


### **B. Backup Methods**

- **Automated Scripts:** Use `rsync`, `robocopy`, or similar tools to copy directories to backup locations.
- **Cloud Sync:** Use services like Google Drive, Dropbox, or Nextcloud for automatic synchronization and versioning.
- **Snapshot Backups:** Periodically create compressed archives (e.g., `.zip` or `.tar.gz`) of your data directories for long-term storage.


### **C. Restore Methods**

- **Full Restore:** Replace the corrupted or lost directory with the backup copy.
- **Partial Restore:** Extract only the needed files from the backup archive.
- **Versioned Restore:** Use backup timestamps to restore data to a specific point in time.


### **D. Special Considerations**

- Ensure all related files for formats like Shapefile (`.shp`, `.dbf`, `.shx`, etc.) are backed up together.
- Maintain metadata files alongside data files.

---

## **3. Database-Based Repositories (e.g., PostgreSQL/PostGIS)**

### **A. Backup Methods**

- **Logical Backups:** Use `pg_dump` to create regular logical backups of your database.

```bash
pg_dump -U username -h host -Fc dbname > dbname_YYYYMMDD.dump
```

- **Physical Backups:** Use file system-level backups or tools like `pg_basebackup` for full database snapshots (especially for larger or mission-critical databases).
- **Automated Scheduling:** Use `cron` (Linux) or Task Scheduler (Windows) to automate backups.


### **B. Restore Methods**

- **Logical Restore:** Use `pg_restore` to restore from a logical backup.

```bash
pg_restore -U username -h host -d dbname dbname_YYYYMMDD.dump
```

- **Partial Restore:** Restore specific tables or schemas if needed.
- **Disaster Recovery:** Document and test procedures for restoring the entire database in case of catastrophic failure.


### **C. Additional Tips**

- Regularly vacuum and analyze your database to maintain performance.
- Back up database configuration files and user/role definitions.

---

## **4. QGIS Project Files**

- Store `.qgz` or `.qgs` project files in the same repository as your data.
- Back up these files along with your data directories or database backups.
- Use relative paths in project files to ensure portability across machines and after restoration.

---

## **5. Versioning and Archiving**

- **Annual Snapshots:** As in your Data Management Plan, copy year directories for historical tracking.
- **Change Logs:** Maintain a simple log or use metadata to record major changes, edits, and backup events.
- **Directory-Based Versioning:** For file-based data, keep dated copies (e.g., `boundaries_2024/`, `boundaries_2025/`).

---

# How can I restore a shared QGIS repository without losing data integrity

Restoring a shared QGIS geospatial repository **without losing data integrity** requires careful planning, adherence to your Data Management Plan, and following best practices for both file-based and database-based storage. Here’s a step-by-step guide tailored for your environment:

---

## 1. **Assess the Scope of Restoration**

- **Identify what needs restoring:** Is it a single layer, a directory (e.g., `DATA/MAIN/boundaries/2022`), or the entire repository?
- **Determine the backup source:** Use the most recent, verified backup (from cloud storage, external drive, or server).

---

## 2. **Prepare the Environment**

- **Notify Users:** Inform all users to stop editing or accessing the affected data to prevent conflicts or data loss during restoration.
- **Check Permissions:** Ensure you have the necessary read/write permissions for all directories and files involved.

---

## 3. **Restore the Data**

### **A. File-Based Repository (e.g., GeoPackage, Shapefiles, Directory Trees)**

1. **Restore Entire Directories or Files:**
    - Use your backup tool (e.g., `rsync`, cloud restore, or manual copy) to restore the required files/directories to their original locations.
    - Make sure to restore all components of multi-file formats (e.g., all `.shp`, `.dbf`, `.shx`, etc. for shapefiles).
2. **Maintain Directory Structure:**
    - Follow your established structure (`DATA/MAIN/subject/year`) to ensure QGIS projects and scripts continue to work seamlessly.
3. **Preserve Metadata:**
    - Restore any associated metadata files (XML, TXT, or QGIS metadata) alongside the data.
4. **Check Data Integrity:**
    - Open restored layers in QGIS and verify that attributes, geometry, and symbology are intact.
    - Use QGIS’s “Check Validity” tool or plugins to validate geometries.
5. **Version Control:**
    - If using directory-based versioning, do not overwrite newer data. Restore to a new directory (e.g., `boundaries_2025_restored/`) and review before replacing current data.

### **B. Database-Based Repository (e.g., PostgreSQL/PostGIS)**

1. **Restore the Database:**
    - Use `pg_restore` (for logical backups) or your chosen database restore tool.
    - Example:

```bash
pg_restore -U username -h host -d dbname dbname_YYYYMMDD.dump
```

2. **Restore Specific Schemas/Tables (if needed):**
    - You can restore only the affected schemas or tables to avoid overwriting unrelated data.
3. **Check Data Integrity:**
    - Run SQL queries to verify record counts, geometry validity, and attribute completeness.
    - Open layers in QGIS and verify display and attribute access.
4. **Reapply Permissions:**
    - Ensure user roles and permissions are reapplied if the database was fully replaced.

---

## 4. **Validate and Document the Restoration**

- **Compare with Backups:** Use file checksums or QGIS to compare restored data with backup copies.
- **Test QGIS Projects:** Open relevant `.qgz` or `.qgs` files to ensure all layers load correctly and maps render as expected.
- **Log the Restoration:** Document what was restored, from which backup, who performed the action, and any issues encountered.

---

## 5. **Reinstate User Access**

- Once validation is complete, notify users that the repository is available and safe to use.
- Encourage users to report any anomalies immediately.

---

## 6. **Prevent Future Issues**

- **Regularly Test Backups:** Periodically perform test restores to ensure your backup process is reliable.
- **Educate Staff:** Train users on proper data handling and reporting data loss or corruption.

---

## **Summary Table: Key Steps for Data-Integrity Restoration**

| Step | File-Based Repository | Database-Based Repository |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Notify users | Yes | Yes |
| Restore data | Copy/restore files \& directories | Use `pg_restore` or similar tools |
| Maintain structure | Follow original directory structure | Restore schemas/tables as needed |
| Restore metadata | Copy metadata files | Ensure metadata tables restored |
| Validate data | Open in QGIS, check validity | Run SQL checks, open in QGIS |
| Reapply permissions | Set file/folder permissions | Set database roles/permissions |

- **Preserve directory structure**: Restore files to their original locations using the same directory structure defined in your Data Management Plan (e.g., `DATA/MAIN/boundaries/2022`).
- **Restore all related files**: For multi-file formats (like shapefiles), ensure all associated files (`.shp`, `.dbf`, `.shx`, etc.) are restored together.

---

## 3. **Maintain Metadata and Documentation**

- **Restore metadata files**: Include all metadata (XML, TXT, or QGIS metadata) alongside the data to retain context, lineage, and documentation.
- **Document the restoration**: Log what was restored, the source and date of the backup, and who performed the restoration.

---

## 4. **Validate Data Integrity**

- **Open and inspect in QGIS**: Load restored layers in QGIS to verify that geometry, attributes, and symbology are intact.
- **Run data validation tools**: Use QGIS’s “Check Validity” tool or plugins to check for geometry errors or attribute inconsistencies.
- **Compare with backup**: Use checksums or file comparison tools to ensure the restored files match the backup.

---

## 5. **Check Permissions and Access Control**

- **Set appropriate permissions**: Ensure restored files and directories have the correct read/write permissions as specified in your Data Management Plan.
- **Enforce read-only status for authoritative data**: For directories like `MAIN` and `PROJECTS`, set files to read-only unless an official update is required.

---

## 6. **For Database-Based Repositories (e.g., PostGIS)**

- **Restore using database tools**: Use `pg_restore` or your backup tool to restore the database or specific tables.
- **Check for schema consistency**: Ensure restored tables and schemas match your standards.
- **Reapply user roles and permissions**: Verify that database permissions align with your documented policies.
- **Validate with SQL and QGIS**: Run SQL queries to check record counts and integrity; open layers in QGIS to confirm access and correctness.

---

## 7. **Final Steps**

- **Test QGIS projects**: Open relevant `.qgz` or `.qgs` project files to confirm all layers load correctly.
- **Notify users**: Once validation is complete, inform staff that the repository is available and safe to use.
- **Encourage reporting**: Ask users to report any anomalies immediately.

# Provide step-by-step instructions for connecting QGIS to PostGIS, configuring a cloud sync and setting up permissions

Certainly! Below are **step-by-step instructions** for:

1. **Connecting QGIS to a PostGIS database**
2. **Configuring a cloud sync for shared data**
3. **Setting up permissions for secure, multi-user access**

These steps are tailored for small, well-organized organizations and align with your [Data Management Plan](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/59416266/04aaa6a9-e511-42bf-a2a9-46db6f887b5b/Data-Management-Plan.md).

---

## 1. Connecting QGIS to PostGIS

**Prerequisites:**

- PostgreSQL and PostGIS are installed and running on a server accessible to your users.
- You have database credentials (host, port, database name, username, password).


### **A. Enable PostGIS Extension (one-time, by admin)**

1. Connect to your PostgreSQL server (e.g., using `psql` or PgAdmin).
2. Run:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION postgis;
```


### **B. Create Users and Database (by admin)**

1. Create a database:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE mygisdb;
```

2. Create a user:

```sql
CREATE USER gisuser WITH PASSWORD 'strongpassword';
```

3. Grant privileges:

```sql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE mygisdb TO gisuser;
```


### **C. Add PostGIS Connection in QGIS**

1. Open QGIS.
2. Go to **Layer > Data Source Manager** (or click the "Data Source Manager" icon).
3. Select **PostgreSQL** from the left menu.
4. Click **New**.
5. Fill in:
    - **Name:** (e.g., "GPMCT PostGIS")
    - **Host:** (e.g., `yourserver.org` or IP address)
    - **Port:** (default is `5432`)
    - **Database:** (e.g., `mygisdb`)
    - **Username:** (e.g., `gisuser`)
    - **Password:** (your password)
6. (Optional) Check "Save Password" for convenience.
7. Click **Test Connection** to verify.
8. Click **OK** to save, then **Connect** to browse and add layers.

---

## 2. Configuring a Cloud Sync for Shared Data

**Goal:** Ensure all users have access to the latest files (e.g., QGIS projects, GeoPackage, shapefiles).

### **A. Choose a Cloud Service**

- **Options:** Nextcloud (self-hosted, open source), Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive.


### **B. Set Up the Shared Folder**

1. Create a main shared folder (e.g., `GPMCT_GIS`).
2. Organize subfolders as per your Data Management Plan (`MAIN`, `PROJECTS`, etc.).
3. Share the folder with all users, giving them appropriate permissions (edit or view-only).

### **C. Install Sync Clients**

1. Each user installs the cloud service’s sync client on their computer.
2. Set the sync client to download the shared folder to a known local path (e.g., `C:\GPMCT_GIS` or `~/GPMCT_GIS`).

### **D. Use Relative Paths in QGIS Projects**

- When saving QGIS projects (.qgz), use **relative paths** so files resolve correctly on all users' systems.


### **E. Best Practices**

- **Avoid simultaneous editing** of the same file (especially shapefiles).
- For collaborative editing, prefer database layers (like PostGIS) over file-based layers.

---

## 3. Setting Up Permissions

### **A. Database Permissions (PostGIS)**

1. **Schema/Table Permissions:**
    - Connect as the database admin.
    - Grant read-only access:

```sql
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO readonlyuser;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO readonlyuser;
```

    - Grant editing access:

```sql
GRANT INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO editoruser;
```

2. **Future Tables:**
    - To automatically grant permissions on new tables:

```sql
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public
GRANT SELECT ON TABLES TO readonlyuser;
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public
GRANT INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON TABLES TO editoruser;
```

3. **Role Management:**
    - Assign users to roles (`readonlyuser`, `editoruser`) as appropriate.

### **B. Cloud Folder Permissions**

- Set folder permissions in your cloud service’s web interface:
    - **View-only** for users who should not edit.
    - **Edit** for users who need to upload or change files.
- **Document** who has access and at what level, as per your Data Management Plan.
