# My common (and not so common) Git commands. 

This is mostly a log for myself of stuff I don't do every day so I don't have to Google it all the time.

1. Initialize a directory with Git and point it to a remote, empty (like Github) repo that I created.

This assumes that you are working on a workstation (or in shell environment) where you have already setup your git globals. It also assumes that the remote repo is empty. It might error abut not pulling first. If the remote is empty, try a `git pull origin main` before the push.

If youâ€™re using Git 2.28.0 or a later version, you can set the name of the default branch using -b.


```bash
git init -b main
# Adds the files in the local repository and stages them for commit. To unstage a file, use `git reset HEAD YOUR-FILE`.

git add .
git commit -m "First commit"
git remote add origin <remote repository URL>
git push -f origin main
```

or from Github itself, where the repo is called 'fitness'

```bash
echo "# fitness" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/johnzastrow/fitness.git
git push -u origin main
```
