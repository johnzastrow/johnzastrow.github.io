# My attempt to measure network performance at home

This is mostly a log for myself of stuff I don't do every day so I don't have to Google it all the time.

### This worked. Trial 1: Sending from Windows to Linux with a single core on each


#### receiver, on linux

``` ntttcp -r -m 1,*,192.168.1.27 -t 60 -V ```

Only one core is used to emulate iperf3 and the V (verbose) 
After downloading the ntttcp.exe binary to Windows we can run it immediately as a sender in a command prompt:

#### sender, on windows
``` ntttcp.exe -s -m 1,*,192.168.1.27 -l 128K -t 60 -ns ```


#### Results
