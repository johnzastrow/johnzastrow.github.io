## Measuring my home network performance

### Background

This is mostly a log for myself of stuff I don't do every day so I don't have to Google it all the time. The first article at the bottom is where I poached most of this content from. His article pretty much says it all - including that commands and binaries differ between Linux and Windows. This video also explains more.

{: .box-warning}
This is just a start of my network benchmarking journey, especially as I'm adding hard wiring to my office hopefully this month. I'll log my methods and results over time here.


### Rant

I don't know why such a fundamental thing as network performance measurement in this age is such a confusing, hot mess, with crappy hard tools. We're ALL doing video calls these days and Internet access is more critical than most other services. 

So please someone develop cheap/free, easy, and ideally unified tool to help isolate issues and bonus for recommending possible corrective actions in Small-Office-Home-Office types of topologies. Imagine knitting together functions from <i>iperf/ntttcp</i> for throughput (except have it be something new written in <i>Rust</i> in some kind of a unified way so the commands, outputs, behaviors match across platforms) with something like a modern <i>Smokeping</i> for latency/quality, but with hop awareness too like <i>pathping</i> , but in a unified interface with sensible defaults so that it just discovers other monitoring devices and works. Then chain the results together.

It could run from say three (3) raspberry pi's (on the LAN, some wired, some wifi) and maybe a $5 VPS at Linode/Digital Ocean. Each node would be the same, they'd talk and gather stats and be aware of where they on the topology. Then present results with some vision on variance across time (then re-run in different positions to check for variance across space). Bonus points for making recommendations, "This wifi leg from a Pi in the living room is the cause of the latency and dropped packets to the internet, not your internet connection because once it hits the router everything is with good ranges (X,Y)"

### Resources and Methods

Use the links to the *different* Github projects at the bottom if you want to try this either for Windows or Linux or both. For Windows you can just download and run the .exe. For Linux they couldn't be bothered to provide binaries and I'm not getting anything searching. But it's simple matter of downloading the source code, expanding the .zip, go into the src/ directory, then ``` make/sudo make install ```

For this testing I'll present the results from ntttcp, both Linux and Windows variants, under a few scenarios.

### The Network

Just a snap of what I'm testing

### Results

Summary table of the tests. Note the asterisks in the commands are getting markdown'd so I had to escape them.

### This worked. Trial 1: Sending from Windows to Linux with a single core on each

#### Receiver, on Linux

``` ntttcp -r -m 1,*,192.168.1.27 -t 60 -V ```

Only one core is used to emulate iperf3 and the V (verbose) 
After downloading the ntttcp.exe binary to Windows we can run it immediately as a sender in a command prompt:

#### Sender, on Windows

``` ntttcp.exe -s -m 1,*,192.168.1.27 -l 128K -t 60 -ns ```

#### Some results

The parts we are most interested in are the following. Looks like 4.749 MB/s or 37.993 Mbps (?) leaving my Lenovo 1 liter with "11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-11400T @ 1.30GHz   1.30 GHz" and wifi over "Intel(R) Wi-Fi 6 AX201 160MHz" at 2.4 Ghz oddly skipping the Unifi Wifi 6 WAP I have two floors directly below, instead connecting further away also two floors below to the Unifi Dream Machine instead.

### Trial 2. This also worked. Reversing the flow

 Weâ€™ll need to run CMD as administrator, open the firewall on the Windows machine to allow it to listen (receive), and the networking benchmark tool with other parameters:

``` netsh advfirewall firewall add rule program=C:\Users\username\Downloads\ntttcp.exe name="ntttcp" protocol=any dir=in action=allow enable=yes profile=ANY ```

#### Receiver, on Windows

then, for Receiver on Windows

``` ntttcp.exe -r -m 1,*,192.168.1.39 -ns -t 60 -V ```

#### Sender, on Linux

and the sender on linux, which is quite different

``` ntttcp -s -m 1,*,192.168.1.39 -b 128K -N -t 60 -V ```

#### The run as shown on the sender, here linux, and in progress. I like the log that update at the hottom with the `-V` (verbose). It shows `Real-time throughput: 26.11Mbps` which I'm not sure how useful or accurate it is, but it's cute.

I think you actually report from the receiver side.
