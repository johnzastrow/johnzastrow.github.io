## My attempt to measure network performance at home

This is mostly a log for myself of stuff I don't do every day so I don't have to Google it all the time. The first article at the bottom is where I poached most of this content from. His article pretty much says it all - including that commands and binaries differ between Linux and Windows. This video also explains more. 

I don't know why such a fundamental thing as network performance measurement in this age is such a confusing, hot mess, with crappy hard tools. We're ALL doing video calls these days and Internet access is more critical than most other services.

### This worked. Trial 1: Sending from Windows to Linux with a single core on each

#### Receiver, on Linux

``` ntttcp -r -m 1,*,192.168.1.27 -t 60 -V ```

Only one core is used to emulate iperf3 and the V (verbose) 
After downloading the ntttcp.exe binary to Windows we can run it immediately as a sender in a command prompt:

#### Sender, on Windows

``` ntttcp.exe -s -m 1,*,192.168.1.27 -l 128K -t 60 -ns ```

#### Results as shown on the sender

The parts we are most interested in are the following. Looks like 4.749 MB/s or 37.993 Mbps (?) leaving my Lenovo 1 liter with "11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-11400T @ 1.30GHz   1.30 GHz" and wifi over "Intel(R) Wi-Fi 6 AX201 160MHz" at 2.4 Ghz oddly skipping the Unifi Wifi 6 WAP I have two floors directly below, instead connecting further away also two floors below to the Unifi Dream Machine instead.

### Trial 2. This also worked. Reversing the flow

 Weâ€™ll need to run CMD as administrator, open the firewall on the Windows machine to allow it to listen (receive), and the networking benchmark tool with other parameters:

``` netsh advfirewall firewall add rule program=C:\Users\username\Downloads\ntttcp.exe name="ntttcp" protocol=any dir=in action=allow enable=yes profile=ANY ```

#### Receiver, on Windows

then, for Receiver on Windows

``` ntttcp.exe -r -m 1,*,192.168.1.39 -ns -t 60 -V ```

#### Sender, on Linux

and the sender on linux, which is quite different

``` ntttcp -s -m 1,*,192.168.1.39 -b 128K -N -t 60 -V ```

#### The run as shown on the sender, here linux

The results above don't show MB/s here, so we'll go with 31.79 Mbps, which is being sent by a 4 CPU linux VM on a 1 year old, otherwise idling AMD workstation running Proxmox hardwired to the Unifi Dream Machine that the 1 liter is wifing to.

The results from the receiver (Windows) above show 3.757 MB/s and 60.118 Mbps (I think), but 90 errors which is interesting.
