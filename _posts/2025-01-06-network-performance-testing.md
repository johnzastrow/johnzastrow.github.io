## My attempt to measure network performance at home

This is mostly a log for myself of stuff I don't do every day so I don't have to Google it all the time. The first article at the bottom where I am poaching this from pretty much says it all. This video also explains more. I don't know why such a fundamental thing as network performance measure in this age is such a confusing, hot mess, with crappy tools.

### This worked. Trial 1: Sending from Windows to Linux with a single core on each

#### Receiver, on Linux

``` ntttcp -r -m 1,*,192.168.1.27 -t 60 -V ```

Only one core is used to emulate iperf3 and the V (verbose) 
After downloading the ntttcp.exe binary to Windows we can run it immediately as a sender in a command prompt:

#### Sender, on Windows

``` ntttcp.exe -s -m 1,*,192.168.1.27 -l 128K -t 60 -ns ```

#### Results as shown on the sender

### Reversing the flow

 Weâ€™ll need to run CMD as administrator, open the firewall on the Windows machine to allow it to listen (receive), and the networking benchmark tool with other parameters:

``` netsh advfirewall firewall add rule program=C:\Users\username\Downloads\ntttcp.exe name="ntttcp" protocol=any dir=in action=allow enable=yes profile=ANY ```

#### Receiver, on Windows

then, for Receiver on Windows

``` ntttcp.exe -r -m 1,*,192.168.1.39 -ns -t 60 -V ```

#### Sender, on Linux

and the sender on linux, which is quite different

``` ntttcp -s -m 1,*,192.168.1.39 -b 128K -N -t 60 -V ```
