I've always worked to think critically about the information I'm exposed to. It's a muscle I exercise regularly - and in fact as a freedom-loving American citizen, it's my right and duty. Here are some workouts I'd like to try.

Actually I'm just in the process of copy and pasting things that I'll go through later. For some reason it seems the banners and and those working against banning/challenging of books are reluctant to post compiled lists of this literature. It seems that both groups would want to shout these lists from the rooftops to accomplish their goals.
