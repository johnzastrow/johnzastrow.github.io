From the PostGIS Listserv comes a very useful comparison table that has been partially vetted by the members of the list. I just wish they included Oracle Spatial and Oracle Locator.

 /&gt; As part of our due diligence work, we are formulating a comparison of the  
 /&gt; spatial functionality offered by SQL Server 2008 Spatial, PostGIS and MySQL.  
 /&gt; Its currently in draft, but we hope to release within the next week.  
 /&gt;  
 /&gt; We would appreciate if people could take a quick look at it and let us know  
 /&gt; if you see any gross errors or important things we left out. Most of this  
 /&gt; information we curled from reading the help docs of each product and from  
 /&gt; our general familiarity with the databases and GIS products out there. We  
 /&gt; tried to be as fair as possible.
