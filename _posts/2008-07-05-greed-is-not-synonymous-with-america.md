But it’s getting harder to prove that point to myself when I read things like this.

Vanity and Vulgarity at Enron

“In one tape, after enduring a bit of ribbing about “how much money you  
guys stole from those poor grandmothers in California,” a trader says,  
“Yeah, Grandma Millie, man. But she’s the one who couldn’t figure out  
how to (expletive) vote on the butterfly ballotâEuro¦” The first  
speaker responds, “Yeah, now she wants her (expletive) money back for  
all the power you’ve… jammed right up her (expletive) for (expletive)  
250 dollars a megawatt-hour.”

Pride  
has always been the fatal flaw. Just look at literature. From Homer to  
Hamlet and even Harry Potter (news – web sites), hubris is the vice  
that brings down the mighty.

These days, our most visible dramas tend to play out in legal action,  
and some pretty compelling language has come to light in the Snohomish  
County, Wash., Public Utilities District’s (PUD) efforts to obtain  
compensation from Enron (OTC BB: ENRNQ.PK – News) for alleged market  
manipulation.

Recent transcripts of conversations between Enron’s West Coast energy  
traders offer vivid proof that the firm’s sophisticated, self-obsessed  
thieves didn’t just hold a dim view of its unwitting stockholders.  
Public entities, like the state of California, were considered easy  
prey. Timothy Belden, one of two traders from the Portland office who  
have pled guilty and cut a deal with prosecutors, says on one tape that  
the firm’s trading practices “just (expletive) California… to the  
tune of a million bucks or two a day.”

As you might expect, these guys harbored no affection for the rest of  
us, either. You and I — derisively referred to as “Grandma Millie” by  
the traders — are looked at as ignorant rubes, ripe for the rip-off.

In one tape, after enduring a bit of ribbing about “how much money you  
guys stole from those poor grandmothers in California,” a trader says,  
“Yeah, Grandma Millie, man. But she’s the one who couldn’t figure out  
how to (expletive) vote on the butterfly ballotâEuro¦” The first  
speaker responds, “Yeah, now she wants her (expletive) money back for  
all the power you’ve… jammed right up her (expletive) for (expletive)  
250 dollars a megawatt-hour.”

Other tapes document traders’ nefarious plans such as sending power  
away from areas that needed it, manufacturing grid congestion that  
Enron would later be paid to alleviate. They also capture the hope that  
then-candidate George W. Bush might someday appoint Ken Lay as U.S.  
energy secretary.

“How great would that be for all the players in the market?” one asked.

Pretty great, I’ll bet. And given the unbelievable arrogance displayed  
by this gaggle of crooks — they knew these conversations were being  
taped, for crying out loud — we should be mighty glad it didn’t come  
to pass. But most of all, we should hope that this kind of criminal  
conceit is punished as mightily in our courtrooms as it is in fiction.
