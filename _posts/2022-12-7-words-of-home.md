# Intro 

Our town motto is, "Young in spirit. Ageless in pride." While I'm not sure about the first part, I am sure about second.

Below are words that come to my mind when I think of Youngstown, though Iâ€™m sure other people would have different words to describe this place. I have added and discarded probably about 50 words, and these are the ones that remain for me. Words left out are just as important.

# The Words

Home, Historic, Family, Roots, Simple, Community, Safe, Basic, Practical, Stable, Timeless, Proud, Storied, Tranquil, Calming, Stoic, Nurturing, Sheltering, Blessed, Native, Blue-collar, Agriculture, Industry, Water, Clay, Sun, Clouds, Sailing, Fishing,  Shrunken, Insular, Stuck, Dependent, Independent,
