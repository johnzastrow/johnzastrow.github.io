If your writing a shell script and want to watch exactly what is going on (very usefull for debugging purposes), add the line

```
set -vx
```

 in the beginning of the script.

The shell script will then output what itâ€™s doing so you can watch.

This can also be done via command line by doing

```
</p>
<p>sh -x filename
```
