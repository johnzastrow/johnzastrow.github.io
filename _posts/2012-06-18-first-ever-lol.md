I’ve never used the acronym LOL in a message to anyone before. But I did LOL when I read this (and still am LOLing) and so I sent this link to a few selected colleagues. This won’t make sense to you unless you use ESRI products or are a GISer. But if you fall into either or both of these, you may get as much pleasure out of this graphic as I do.
